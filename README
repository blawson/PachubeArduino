Arduino Cosm Library

This library will make setting up and connecting your Arduino device to Cosm a much easier exercise.

You are required to include the Ethernet library in your Arduino Sketch for the Cosm client to compile correctly.


-- Examples

 In the examples directory you will see some Arduino sketch code for setting up to connect to Cosm. You can connect via DHCP, or by specifying a static IP, or by providing gatway and DNS info if you need to route your updates more precisely.

 I have tested the code for DHCP configuration, but don't have the setup at the moment to properly test the gateway code. If you find bugs please let me know and I will try and update the code quickly.

 Thanks for checking the library out, good luck!
